This is a simple tool used for making fly-through videos of 3D models, built on
top of Panda3D. It supports visualizing (simple) OBJ, PLY, and X3D files in an
interactive window.

Requirements:
- Panda3D
- NumPy
- imageio (or another library that will save image files)

Feel free to contribute or raise an issue!
