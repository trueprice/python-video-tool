This is a simple tool used for making fly-through videos of 3D models, built on
top of Panda3D. It supports visualizing (simple) PLY and X3D files in an
interactive window. The user can manually position the camera and add keyframe
poses that are then interpolated to create the flythough.

Requirements:
- Panda3D
- NumPy
- imageio (or another library that will save image files)

Feel free to contribute or raise an issue! There are some additional features
implemented but not yet in this repository, including support for OBJ files and
textured meshes.
